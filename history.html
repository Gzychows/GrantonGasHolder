                The Granton gas holder in Edinburgh is a prominent landmark for
                over a century, towering over the surrounding area and serving
                as a crucial component of the city's energy infrastructure.
                However, its history is intertwined with that of the Granton Gas
                Works, which supplied gas to the city for many years.

                The Granton Gas Works was established in the late 1800s as part
                of a network of gas suppliers serving Edinburgh. The works were
                located on the Firth of Forth, near the Granton Harbour, which
                provided a convenient location for receiving coal shipments by
                sea. The works produced coal gas through a process of heating
                coal in retorts, which produced a gas that could be purified and
                distributed to customers via a network of pipes.

                One of the most visible components of the Granton Gas Works was
                the gas holder, a large storage tank that held the purified gas
                before it was distributed to customers. The Granton gas holder
                was constructed in 1890 by the Granton Gas Company, which later
                merged with several other gas companies to form the Edinburgh
                Gas Company. The holder was a massive structure, with a diameter
                of over 70 meters and a height of over 50 meters, and could hold
                over 5 million cubic feet of gas.

                The Granton Gas Works played an important role in the
                industrialization of the area, providing employment for many
                local people. The works produced a variety of products,
                including coal tar, which was used in the production of dyes and
                chemicals, as well as ammonia, which was used in the production
                of fertilizers. The gas produced at the works was also used to
                power the city's trams.

                The Granton gas holder played a crucial role in supplying gas to
                the city during times of war, such as World War I, when it was
                used to produce gas for the war effort. However, as the energy
                market changed and alternative sources of energy became more
                prominent, the role of the Granton gas holder in supplying gas
                to the city declined. By the 1970s and 1980s, the holder was no
                longer the crucial component of the city's energy infrastructure
                that it once was.

                The renovation project, which is being led by the Edinburgh
                Sculpture Workshop, involves the removal of the tank's internal
                structure to create a large, open space that can be used for a
                variety of purposes. The tank's exterior will also be repainted
                to restore it to its former glory. The project has received
                funding from a variety of sources, including the Scottish
                Government's Regeneration Capital Grant Fund.

                The restoration of the Granton Gas Holder is an exciting project
                that will help to preserve an important part of Edinburgh's
                industrial heritage. The new public space will provide a unique
                venue for community events and cultural activities, and will
                help to attract visitors to the area. The project is expected to
                be completed in 2024, and will be a fitting tribute to the
                history of the Granton Gas Holder and Gas Works.
