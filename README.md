# GrantonGasHolder
This project is for Edinburgh College NPA Software development and web course. The purpose of this project is to work in a team and create a website that would promote the  Granton Gas Holder.

Edinburgh college have commissioned me and my team to develop an engaging and informative website to help raise awareness of the Granton Gas holder project. Edinburgh college students have been involved in the lighting of the Granton Gas holder and various creative and multimedia events to promote the gas holder project. The Granton gas holder is the centre piece of what is a £1.3bn regeneration of the Granton waterfront area. The website must feature the following pages home, history, gallery, location, live, links and contact.
•	Home - information about the gas holder and engaging design and quality images
•	History
•	Gallery – at least 8 excellent quality images showcasing the gas holder and an embedded video of the gas holder.
•	Location – images, address and an embedded google map showing location
•	Live – this will feature a live stream video of the gas holder
•	Links – at least 10 links to relevant external websites documenting the gas holder (newspapers etc….)
•	Contact – featuring a contact form

The client is open to the addition of any further web pages that it is felt would be useful to add. 
The website must be professionally designed and full of informative, useful and engaging multimedia content. The design must appeal to the target audience of people interested in Granton gas holder and its history, mostly from Edinburgh and the surrounding area. The website should be easy to use and accessible to all. The website must also feature a text-based logo on every web page throughout the web site. There must also be a navigation bar which links to every page throughout the site and a footer element on every page. SEO considerations must be included in the content and source code. The source code should be appropriately commented and easy to maintain. 
Useful functionality such as a newsletter sign-up that allows users to enter their email address and stores their email address would be a welcome addition to the website but is not mandatory as the client has concerns about GDPR. Any other useful content or functionality would be apprieciated.
The website must be completed, fully tested and published to a web server by Friday 12th May @ 23:55.
